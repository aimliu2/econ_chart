# Fallacies

## Ad Hominem - Mudslinging
_Attack on the person making the claim, not the claim itself_

**why it is invalid** : politicians can use them to manipulate voters' opinions against an opponent without addressing core issues.

Examples

[personal attacked](https://thebestschools.org/magazine/15-logical-fallacies-know/#ad-hominem)
> MacDougal roots for a British football team. Clearly he's unfit to be a police chief in Ireland

[dig dirt](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ad-hominem)
> After Sally presents an eloquent and compelling case for a more equitable taxation system, Sam asks the audience whether we should believe anything from a woman who isn't married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird.

## Appeal to Authority
_Appeal to authority is the misuse of an authority's opinion to support an argument_

**why it is invalid** : it becomes a fallacy if their expertise or authority is overstated, illegitimate, or irrelevant to the topic.

Examples

[Because my teacher says so](https://thebestschools.org/magazine/15-logical-fallacies-know/#appeal-to-authority)
> One day robots will enslave us all. It's true. My computer science teacher says so.

**GMAT Critical Reasoning Practice Test**

> My history professor is recognized as an expert on the Kennedy assassination. He said in class that there had to be a second shooter on the grassy knoll. Therefore, there had to be another shooter, meaning Oswald was framed.

## Bandwagon - common sense ?
_if everyone thinks a certain way, then you should, too._

**why it is invalid** : the broad acceptance of a claim or action doesn't mean that it's factually justified.

Examples

[everyone does it](https://thebestschools.org/magazine/15-logical-fallacies-know/#bandwagon)

> "Almost everyone at my school will be at the party Friday night. It must be the right thing to do."

---

## Post Hoc - Myth
_if B occurs after A, then A causes B_

**why it is invalid** : It might be a coincidence. Without proper explanation, people will believe it.

Examples

[Autism and Vaccine, 2000s](https://www.thoughtco.com/post-hoc-fallacy-1691650)

> During the early **2000s**, the search for a cause of autism led to vaccines. 
>
> Though no scientific link has been found between the administration of vaccines and the onset of autism. 
**The time that children are vaccinated and the time they're diagnosed do closely correlate**; however, leading upset parents to assign blame to the immunizations(vaccine), for lack of a better explanation. 

[Are iPods to Blame for Rising Crime?](https://www.thoughtco.com/post-hoc-fallacy-1691650)

> "The report suggests that 'the rise in violent offending and the **explosion in the sales of iPods and other portable media devices is more than coincidental**,' and asks, rather provocatively, 'Is There an iCrime Wave?' The report notes that nationally, violent crime fell every year from 1993 to 2004, before rising in 2005 and 2006, just as 'Americaâ€™s streets filled with millions of people visibly wearing, and being distracted by, expensive electronic gear.' Of course, as any social scientist will tell you, correlation and causation are not the same thing."

## Red Herring - shfit focus
_shift attention away from a topic and toward a false conclusion_

**why it is invalid** : because it is irrelavant to what we are disscussing.

Examples

[talking about cleanning my garage](https://thebestschools.org/magazine/15-logical-fallacies-know/#red-herring)

> "My roommate wants to talk about cleaning out the garage, so I asked her what she wants to do with our patio furniture. Now she's shopping for new patio furniture and not asking me about the garage."

---

## Slippery Slope - chain reaction
_A certain course of action will lead to another terrible result._

**why it is invalid** : we can not prove it will definitly occured. this fallacy is effective anaginst anxious people.

Examples 

**GMAT Critical Reasoning Practice Test**

> Diane does not think that gay people should get married. She argues that, if gay couples are allowed to get legally married, the next step will be to legalize polygamy and child marriage. Clearly, if we are going to save American society, we must not legalize gay marriages.

---

## Tu quoque/Appeal to Hypocrisy
_you answered criticism with criticism._

**why it is invalid**: it is an attempt to reflect blame (to the accuser).

Examples 

[respond critism with critism](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/tu-quoque)
> Nicole identified that Hannah had committed a logical fallacy, but instead of addressing the substance of her claim, Hannah accused Nicole of committing a fallacy earlier on in the conversation.

[but you did it too](https://thebestschools.org/magazine/15-logical-fallacies-know/#appeal-to-hypocrisy)
> But, Dad, I know you smoked when you were my age, so how can you tell me not to do it?
>
> I don't think smoking is bad since you did it when you were 16.
